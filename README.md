VHDL clone of YM2608 (OPNA) sound chip

The source files here have been clean-room reverse engineered from the 
YM2608 C simulation described in fmgen, MAME, QEMU, and others.
(Links and credits forthcoming.)

Thanks to Peter Barfuss (bofh) for helping understand this device and
for general audio knowhow.
